## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where Alistair encounters another 'dockside Socrates'—a working person who dismantles his abstract philosophy with a single, material observation.
- Compose Mags's internal monologue as she climbs the stairs to Alistair's flat, detailing her own philosophy forged from a life of practical constraints.
- Imagine the letter from the university. Write its full, bureaucratic text, and then write Alistair's stream-of-consciousness reaction to each paragraph.
- Extend the final, truncated sentence of the opening. Where does Alistair's purposeful walk lead him, and what new constraint does he discover?

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Gap Mapper' tool that visualizes the linguistic distance between abstract thought-words and concrete thing-words used in the narrative.
- Create a text generator that mimics the novel's style: combining dense, philosophical introspection with sharply observed, damp, urban Scottish imagery.
